## Brand Colors

### Primary Palette

| Role                  | Hex                                  | Variable               | Usage                                                |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary Teal**      | `#05cd99`                            | `--color-primary`      | Links, borders, buttons, active states, brand accent |
| **Primary Teal Dark** | `#04a87a`                            | `--color-primary-dark` | Hover/pressed states, emphasis                       |
| **Secondary Amber**   | `#CC8800` (light) / `#FFAA33` (dark) | `--color-secondary`    | Secondary accents, warnings, alternative highlights  |

### Neutral Backgrounds

| Role              | Hex       | Variable                       | Usage                                  |
| ----------------- | --------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **White**         | `#ffffff` | `--bg-light`                   | Primary page background (light theme)  |
| **Off-white**     | `#f5f5f5` | `--bg-light-alt`               | Secondary background — sections, cards |
| **Light gray**    | `#eeeeee` | `--services-bg`, `--footer-bg` | Services section, footer               |
| **Near black**    | `#0a0a0a` | `--bg-dark`                    | Primary background (dark theme)        |
| **Dark gray**     | `#1a1a1a` | `--bg-dark-secondary`          | Secondary dark background              |
| **Dark charcoal** | `#141414` | `--bg-dark-tertiary`           | Tertiary dark background               |

### Text Colors

Text colors use opacity-based rgba values for consistent contrast against backgrounds. See [VARIABLES_REFERENCE.md](./VARIABLES_REFERENCE.md#text-colors) for full values.

| Role      | Light Theme            | Dark Theme                |
| --------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Primary   | `rgba(26,26,26, 0.95)` | `rgba(245,245,245, 0.95)` |
| Secondary | `rgba(26,26,26, 0.7)`  | `rgba(200,200,200, 0.8)`  |
| Muted     | `rgba(26,26,26, 0.6)`  | `rgba(200,200,200, 0.6)`  |
| Faded     | `rgba(26,26,26, 0.5)`  | `rgba(200,200,200, 0.5)`  |

## Typography

| Property            | Value                                        |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Font family**     | GST Mono (Geist Mono, OFL 1.1) — self-hosted |
| **Normal weight**   | 400                                          |
| **Semibold weight** | 600                                          |
| **Bold weight**     | 700                                          |

**One family, named.** GST is a monospace brand and now ships the face to prove
it: a subset variable Geist Mono, served from our own origin and aliased as
`GST Mono` so nothing in the repo names the typeface directly. There is no
second family — the sans token points at the mono, because nav links and button
text were its only consumers and the system's own rule is that type is monospace
and tracked. Never write a family name in a stylesheet; go through
`var(--font-family-mono)`. Details and the re-cut recipe:
[TYPOGRAPHY_REFERENCE.md § The pinned mono](./TYPOGRAPHY_REFERENCE.md).

See [TYPOGRAPHY_REFERENCE.md](./TYPOGRAPHY_REFERENCE.md) for the full set of semantic text utility classes.

## Brand Asset: Delta Icon

The GST delta triangle icon is the primary brand mark. It appears as:

- Navigation logo element
- Collapse/expand toggle indicator (`.delta-chevron` in `interactions.css`)
- CSS pseudo-element decorator via mask-image technique
- **Attention/action indicator** in `--color-secondary` (gold) — signals user interaction points

**SVG source**: `/images/logo/gst-delta-icon-teal-stroke-thick.svg`

**Usage rules**:

- Render in `--color-primary` (teal) for branding and decoration
- Render in `--color-secondary` (gold) to signal attention or required user action (e.g., CTAs, interactive prompts)
- Use `currentColor` for stroke when the parent element controls color contextually
- Use the stroke variant for inline/decorative uses
- Scale proportionally; do not distort aspect ratio
- See [STYLES_GUIDE.md — Brand Delta Icon](./STYLES_GUIDE.md#brand-delta-icon) for the CSS mask-image pattern

---

## Design Grid

- **Checkerboard pattern**: 50px grid, painted as two `linear-gradient` background images on `body` itself (not a pseudo-element) with `--checkerboard-line`
- Light theme: `rgba(0,0,0, 0.032)` — subtle dark lines on white
- Dark theme: `rgba(255,255,255, 0.032)` — subtle light lines on dark
- **Consequence for accessibility testing**: because the backdrop is an image, axe-core cannot resolve an opaque background behind most text and reports its contrast as INCOMPLETE, not as a violation. A passing axe scan is therefore not evidence of passing contrast — see [ADR-0035](https://github.com/Global-Strategic-Technologies/gst-website/blob/main/src/docs/adr/0035-ink-tokens-for-text-on-light-surfaces.md)

## Domain Color Families

These colors are tool-specific, not brand-level. They are defined as CSS variables for consistency and dark theme support but are not part of the core brand palette.

### Authority Blue (Shared: Diligence Machine + ICG)

| Theme | Value     | Variable               |
| ----- | --------- | ---------------------- |
| Light | `#5b7a9d` | `--hub-authority-blue` |
| Dark  | `#7a9dbd` | `--hub-authority-blue` |

Used for authority/expertise-themed elements across hub tools.

### Diligence Machine Domain Colors

See [VARIABLES_REFERENCE.md — Diligence Machine Domain Colors](./VARIABLES_REFERENCE.md#diligence-machine-domain-colors).

### ICG Maturity Colors

See [VARIABLES_REFERENCE.md — ICG Maturity Colors](./VARIABLES_REFERENCE.md#icg-maturity-colors).

### TechPar Zone & Chart Colors

See [VARIABLES_REFERENCE.md — TechPar Variables](./VARIABLES_REFERENCE.md#techpar-variables).

## Accessibility

- **Contrast**: All text/background combinations should meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- **Focus indicators**: 2px solid `--color-primary` outline with 2px offset via `.interactive-focus` utility or `:focus-visible` on `.brutal-*` components
- **Color alone**: Never use color as the sole indicator of state — always pair with text, icons, or patterns
- **Touch targets**: 44x44px per WCAG 2.5.5 (Level **AAA**) on the guarded families; **AA's 24x24 (2.5.8) everywhere else**.

  **The ruling, narrowed 2026-08-03 after measurement.** BL-096 first ruled 2.5.5 a site-wide goal with documented exceptions. Applying it turned out to mean visibly rebuilding dense UI — filter chips more than doubling, the header growing on every page, the palette rail widening — all to clear a **AAA** bar. So the operator scoped it back, and the measurement supports that: axe's `target-size` rule (which implements 2.5.8 _including_ its spacing exception) reports **zero failures on 9 of 10 routes at 390px**, covering the 21px chips and the 22px nav links. Those clear AA on spacing; only the AAA figure is unmet.

  > **Correction, same day.** That probe's finding for the **palette rail tabs** was wrong, and the error is worth keeping rather than quietly fixing. It ran only at 390px, where `.palette-panel__edge` is `display: none` and the tabs measure `0×0` — so "clean" meant "not rendered", not "passing". At desktop they are **32×22** and fail `target-size` on both its checks, size and spacing. They are now `min-height: var(--touch-target-min-aa)`. **Probe every viewport a control actually renders at**; a single-viewport sweep reports absence as compliance.
  >
  > This did not reopen the out-of-scope decision below. That closed the rail at **44px (AAA)**, which would have widened fixed chrome site-wide. This is the AA floor, 2px of height, and the rail's 32px width is untouched.

  So the honest statement is a guarantee plus an aspiration, not a site-wide rule with a growing exception list:
  - **Guaranteed and enforced at 44px**: `.brutal-btn`, `.brutal-choice-btn`, `.cta-button`, `.filter-button`, `.modal-close`, `.theme-toggle`.
  - **Everywhere else**: AA 2.5.8 (24×24 or its spacing exception), via `--touch-target-min-aa`. Since 2026-08-03 this is **machine-enforced, not asserted** — `accessibility.test.ts` runs axe with the `wcag22aa` tag, so `target-size` fails CI on every route it scans. 44px is welcome where it costs nothing and is **not** a reason to rebuild a working layout.

  > **One recorded carve-out from the 44px guarantee (2026-08-27).** The MCP onboarding pages' compact per-field Copy buttons (`CopyRow.astro` `.copy-row__btn`, and the Using page's `.field-panel__copy`) render as `.brutal-btn--secondary` but a bespoke scoped class floors them at `--touch-target-min-aa` (24px), per the reviewed design — a five-row argument panel at 44px per row stops reading as one unit. They clear AA 2.5.8 and axe scans those routes; the source guard does not flag them because its matching is by guarded-family class in the CSS selector, and these floors live on the bespoke classes.

  **Measure the target, not the element.** 2.5.5 governs the region that accepts the pointer action, so a 16px checkbox inside a `cursor: pointer` `<label>` is already a label-sized target. Check for a larger clickable ancestor before raising anything.

  **Guarded families** (`--touch-target-min` floor, enforced by [`touch-target-floor.test.ts`](https://github.com/Global-Strategic-Technologies/gst-website/blob/main/tests/integration/touch-target-floor.test.ts)): `.brutal-btn`, `.brutal-choice-btn`, `.cta-button`, `.filter-button`, `.modal-close`, `.theme-toggle`, plus the two exception families below. That guard checks `min-height`/`min-width` **and** `height`/`width` — a fixed `height` is a ceiling as well as a floor, which is how `.theme-toggle` sat at 13.6px. It matches the **last compound** of each selector, so `.filter-button svg { width: 20px }` sizes an icon and is correctly ignored.

  **Fix with `min-height`, not `min-width`**, unless the control is a fixed-size icon button — radar pills must still wrap and scroll, and `.brutal-segmented` is `max-width: 320px; overflow: hidden`.

  **Documented exceptions** live in `FLOOR_EXCEPTIONS` in that test file, each with a reason, and a stale entry fails the suite — so an exception cannot outlive the control it excuses:
  - `.brutal-quick-zoom` (32px) — a world reset plus four region presets overlaying the map itself; 44px targets would overlap or consume ~220px (5 × 44) of vertical map on mobile. Still clears 2.5.8 AA.
  - `.brutal-map-control` (32px) — desktop-only zoom cluster. A **documented deviation, not a WCAG exception**: 2.5.5 governs pointer inputs including the mouse, and scroll/drag are gestures rather than the equivalent _control_ the Equivalent exception requires.

  **Not exempt**, contrary to a common reading: header nav, footer and TOC links. 2.5.5's Inline exception is "the target is in a sentence or block of text" — the line-height clause belongs to 2.5.8. A list of links is not a sentence.

  That matters only for the AAA figure, though — and per the narrowed ruling above, header nav, footer links, TOC links, filter chips and the palette rail are all **out of scope by operator decision (2026-08-03)**: each clears AA 2.5.8, and raising any of them visibly rebuilds working UI. Recorded so nobody re-derives the sweep from first principles and reopens it.

  **The only measured AA failures were on `/brand` itself, and both are fixed** (BL-103, 2026-08-03): the palette editor's RGB tracks (`.swatch-slider`) at 137 nodes of 6px height, and the rail tabs above. The sliders keep their 6px paint — the input is transparent and `::-webkit-slider-runnable-track` / `::-moz-range-track` carry it, the recipe `.brutal-slider__input` already ships in `form.css`. Expanding the hit area with a negative margin instead (the `.theme-toggle` approach) was rejected: those rows sit at a ~15.5px pitch, so 24px boxes would overlap and steal each other's clicks.

  **Under-collected, and deliberately so.** `.brutal-search__result` (~36px listbox option) and `.modal__close` (a different family from `.modal-close`) exist only after an interaction, so the axe guard never reaches them — no scanned route renders them at load. `.brutal-option-card` **passes by padding: do not trim it**, the same caveat § Accessibility already carries for `.cta-button`.

  Three instruments, deliberately: the source scan above catches a declaration resolving too low; [`brand-page.test.ts`](https://github.com/Global-Strategic-Technologies/gst-website/blob/main/tests/e2e/brand-page.test.ts) § Touch targets measures **rendered geometry** at two viewports, which is the only way to catch a control with no floor declared at all — the shape that let `.brutal-btn` sit at 33px; and axe's `target-size` holds the AA floor across every scanned route. `.palette-panel__tab` is in **neither** of the first two: both mean 44px, and the ruling puts the rail at AA

- **Keyboard navigation**: All interactive components are focusable via Tab; modals trap focus; tab bars support arrow keys
- **Live reference**: The [/brand page — Accessibility section](https://globalstrategic.tech/brand#accessibility) demonstrates focus states, contrast ratios, touch targets, keyboard patterns, ARIA usage, and semantic HTML structure

## Semantic Color System

Shared status colors for use across all tools and components. Derived from battle-tested values in TechPar, ICG, and Diligence Machine.

| Variable          | Light     | Dark      | Usage                                                               |
| ----------------- | --------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--color-success` | `#2e8b57` | `#3da868` | Positive outcomes, passing states                                   |
| `--color-warning` | `#CC8800` | `#FFAA33` | Caution indicators, borderline states (aliases `--color-secondary`) |
| `--color-error`   | `#d93636` | `#e05050` | Failures, negative KPIs, critical alerts                            |
| `--color-info`    | `#05cd99` | `#05cd99` | Informational highlights (aliases `--color-primary`)                |

**These are fill and border colours.** As text they fail AA on light surfaces; text uses the matching ink — `--color-success-ink`, `--color-warning-ink`, `--color-error-ink` (and `--color-secondary-ink`). Brand teal `--color-primary` is the exception and stays teal as text. See [ADR-0035](https://github.com/Global-Strategic-Technologies/gst-website/blob/main/src/docs/adr/0035-ink-tokens-for-text-on-light-surfaces.md).

Tool-specific status variables (e.g. `--dm-success`, `--techpar-kpi-negative`) may reference these shared values for consistency, but existing tool palettes remain valid within their own scope.

---

## Alternative Palette System

Six color palettes are defined in `src/styles/palettes.css`, enabling stakeholders to preview the entire site in alternative brand directions. The active palette is applied as a class on `<html>` (e.g., `html.palette-1`), mirroring the dark-theme pattern, and persisted via `localStorage('palette')`.

| ID  | Name                     | Primary           | Secondary         | Character                               |
| --- | ------------------------ | ----------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 0   | **Current** (production) | Teal `#05cd99`    | Amber `#CC8800`   | The baseline                            |
| 1   | **Steel Authority**      | Cobalt `#1e40af`  | Magenta `#db2777` | PE gravitas with an unexpected edge     |
| 2   | **Indigo Signal**        | Violet `#7c3aed`  | Lime `#84cc16`    | Breaks every finance-blue convention    |
| 3   | **Copper Forge**         | Rust `#b45309`    | Cyan `#0891b2`    | Industrial heat meets cold precision    |
| 4   | **Jade Edge**            | Emerald `#059669` | Rose `#f43f5e`    | Current teal pushed to its boldest form |
| 5   | **Shadow Garden**        | Forest `#166534`  | Violet `#a855f7`  | Terminal in an old-growth forest        |

Each palette overrides the 9 core tokens (`--color-primary`, `--color-primary-dark`, `--color-secondary`, `--color-success`, `--color-warning`, `--color-error`, `--color-authority`, `--color-distinguish`, `--color-subdued`) plus derived accent/border/opacity scales. All tool-domain colors cascade automatically.

**How to preview:** Open the PalettePanel on the `/brand` page (right-edge tab bar). Click the middle delta icon to "pop out" the panel to all pages.

**Important:** Palette 0 is the production palette. Alternative palettes are for stakeholder review only — they are not deployed to production.

## Color Usage Hierarchy

When choosing a color, follow this priority order:

| Priority | Color Family                                                             | When to Use                                          | Examples                                                  |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | **Primary teal** (`--color-primary`)                                     | Interactive elements, brand accents, data highlights | Links, buttons, focus rings, active states, hover borders |
| 2        | **Secondary amber** (`--color-secondary`)                                | Secondary emphasis, alternative highlights           | Warning badges, secondary CTAs, TechPar zone indicators   |
| 3        | **Semantic** (`--color-success/warning/error/info`)                      | Status indicators, validation, alerts                | Form errors, maturity levels, success confirmations       |
| 4        | **Neutrals** (`--text-*`, `--bg-*`, `--border-*`)                        | Body content, backgrounds, borders                   | Default for all non-interactive, non-status content       |
| 5        | **Domain** (`--hub-*`, `--dm-*`, `--icg-*`, `--techpar-*`, `--regmap-*`) | Tool-specific contexts only                          | Never used outside their owning tool                      |

**Rules**:

- Primary teal is the only color for primary CTAs — never use secondary amber or semantic colors for the primary action
- Semantic colors must always be paired with text or an icon — never rely on color alone (accessibility requirement)
- Domain colors are scoped to their tool and must not leak into shared components

---

## Color Contrast Requirements

All text and UI element pairings must meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast minimums:

| Element Type                                            | Minimum Contrast Ratio |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Normal text (< 18px or < 14px bold)                     | 4.5:1                  |
| Large text (≥ 18px or ≥ 14px bold)                      | 3:1                    |
| Non-text UI elements (borders, icons, focus indicators) | 3:1                    |

**Fill versus ink ([ADR-0035](https://github.com/Global-Strategic-Technologies/gst-website/blob/main/src/docs/adr/0035-ink-tokens-for-text-on-light-surfaces.md))**: brand and status colours are fill and border colours. Used as text on a light surface they fail AA — `--color-primary` 2.06:1, `--color-secondary`/`--color-warning` 2.96:1 — so text uses the `-ink` tokens. **Brand teal is exempt by decision**: `--color-primary` text, delta icons and focus rings stay teal, accepting 2.06:1 on light surfaces, because a darker substitute reads as a different brand colour. Inks are unchanged in dark theme. `tests/integration/ink-token-contrast.test.ts` guards every ink in all six palettes.

**`--text-muted` usage**: Opacity is `0.65` in light theme and `0.6` in dark, yielding ~5.4:1 on `#ffffff` and ~4.7:1 on `#0a0a0a`. Both clear the 4.5:1 AA floor for normal text, but only just — so restrict `--text-muted` to large text (≥ 18px), labels, captions, placeholder text, and decorative/disabled elements. For sustained normal-sized body text, use `--text-secondary` or higher. The live per-theme ratios are rendered on `/brand` under Accessibility → Color Contrast Ratios.

### CVD-Safe Sequence for Future Charts

For multi-series charts (max 6 colors), use this sequence for adequate color vision deficiency separation:

1. Teal — `--color-primary`
2. Blue — `--hub-authority-blue`
3. Amber — `--color-secondary`
4. Red — `--color-error`
5. Purple — `--regmap-category-industry`
6. Brown — `--dm-methodology-brown`

**Rule**: Always pair color with a secondary differentiator (pattern fill, label, position, shape) for color-blind accessibility.

### Placement Guidelines

- **Navigation**: Top-left in the logo wrapper. Always paired with "GST" text.
- **Toggles**: Inline-end position within collapsible headers. Rotates 0°↔180° via `.delta-chevron`.
- **Decorative**: As `::before`/`::after` pseudo-elements via CSS mask-image. Teal only.
- **Attention / CTA**: Inline-start position paired with instructional text. Gold (`--color-secondary`) to signal user action. Used in `.brutal-map-cta` and similar interactive prompts.
- **Print**: Unicode delta character `\0394` in document headers.
