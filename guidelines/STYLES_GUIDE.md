## Quick Start by Task

**Adding a new component:**

1. Use CSS variables for all colors, spacing, and typography — see [VARIABLES_REFERENCE.md](./VARIABLES_REFERENCE.md)
2. Use typography utility classes — see [TYPOGRAPHY_REFERENCE.md](./TYPOGRAPHY_REFERENCE.md)
3. Test in both light and dark themes and all 6 palettes
4. Check responsive behavior at 768px and 480px breakpoints

**Styling text:** Pick a utility class from [TYPOGRAPHY_REFERENCE.md](./TYPOGRAPHY_REFERENCE.md) (`.brutal-heading-lg`, `.brutal-text-base`, `.brutal-label`, etc.). Dark theme colors switch automatically.

**Need a specific color/spacing value:** Look it up in [VARIABLES_REFERENCE.md](./VARIABLES_REFERENCE.md). Use the variable, never a hardcoded value.

**Dark theme broken:** You almost certainly hardcoded a color. Replace it with `var(--variable-name)`.

## In-repo Control Examples

**The brand page is the living control-example surface for this design system — start there before building anything visual.** It renders real tokens and real component classes at runtime and reacts to the theme toggle and all six palettes, so what you see is what the system currently produces, not a static mockup.

- **Page**: [src/pages/brand.astro](https://github.com/Global-Strategic-Technologies/gst-website/blob/main/src/pages/brand.astro) — composition, section layout, and the specimen styling
- **Specimen components**: [src/components/brand/](https://github.com/Global-Strategic-Technologies/gst-website/blob/main/src/components/brand/) — color swatches with live token values (`BrandColors`, `ColorSpecimens`), the typography/spacing/transition ladders (`BrandTypography`), real production component specimens and state matrices (`BrandComponents`, `BrandUILibrary`), accessibility patterns (`BrandAccessibility`), and the palette editor (`PalettePanel`)
- **How to use them**: when building a new component or page, find the nearest specimen and copy its classes and token usage — do not restyle from scratch. If a pattern you need has no specimen, that's a signal to check [VARIABLES_REFERENCE.md](./VARIABLES_REFERENCE.md) and the component CSS modules before inventing anything new
- **Verifying palette/theme behavior**: open `/brand` in `npm run dev`, use the PalettePanel (always visible there; pop-out makes it available on every page) to switch themes and palettes live — see [BRAND_GUIDELINES.md](./BRAND_GUIDELINES.md) § Alternative Palette System
- The rendered page at [globalstrategic.tech/brand](https://globalstrategic.tech/brand) is the shareable form of the same surface for reviewers without repo access

### How a specimen relates to what ships

Because you are told to copy from these specimens, a specimen that has drifted from production
teaches the wrong thing — which is worse than having no specimen. Every specimen must therefore use
one of three mechanisms, in this order of preference (BL-095):

1. **Render the real component.** Structurally cannot drift. The default, and what to do for anything
   renderable in isolation — `Breadcrumb`, `StatsBar`, `WireItem`, `TableOfContents`, `DeltaIcon`,
   `CompositeLogo`, `HeaderLogo`, `HeaderNavLinks`, `ThemeToggleButton`, `FooterLinks` and `CTABox`
   are live components on `/brand`, not copies of them. **A singleton shell does not exempt its
   contents**: when a component cannot render twice only because of its wrapper (`Header`'s
   `role="banner"` + sticky shell, `ThemeToggle`'s `#themeToggle` + bound script, `CTASection`'s
   `id="contact"`), extract the presentational inner into its own component — the wrapper keeps the
   id/script/landmark, the inner carries the markup and scoped styles, and `/brand` renders the inner
   (BL-095 AC-2). Demo-facing props on such inners follow one rule: passing the override keeps links
   in-page AND drops any analytics handler, so a specimen click never emits a real tracking event
   (see `HeaderNavLinks.astro`'s docblock for why the production branch is literal markup, not a
   data model).
2. **Converged replica — the FINAL classification for the portfolio family** (`ProjectModal`,
   `PortfolioHeader`, `StickyControls`, `FilterDrawer`), not a deferral: they own the portfolio
   filter/modal runtime (dozens of singleton ids and bound handlers), and no presentational inner
   exists to extract without surgery on working production code that would only improve
   documentation. Their end state is a converged replica + a source comment naming the file to keep
   in sync with. Guard rule: a parity test (in `tests/e2e/brand-page.test.ts` § "Site chrome
   specimens match production") compares computed styles against the live component **on the same
   page** when it renders there, never against literal values; when nothing renders the component on
   `/brand` — the portfolio family's case — a cross-page guard against a stable production route is
   the fallback where one exists (the `.project-card` guard is the model), and the sync comment is
   the floor.
3. **Plain CSS class, no component.** Most `.brutal-*` specimens: the class lives in
   `src/styles/components/*.css` with no `.astro` component behind it, so writing the markup *is*
   rendering the real thing. Nothing to converge on.

Two standing rulings from the BL-095 closeout (2026-08-08):

- **`/brand` embeds cards, never full `<section>`s.** `WhyClientsTrustUs` / `EngagementFlow` /
  `WhoWeSupport` / `WhatWeDo` are isolation-safe but each renders a whole section whose heading
  would pollute the `/brand` TOC (built from `h3[id]`), and the specimen slot wants one card. Their
  card specimens stay replicas under mechanism 2/3; if one measurably drifts, the remedy is a
  card-level presentational extraction (mechanism 1's pattern), not embedding the section.
- **No components are created solely so `/brand` can render them.** The service card, founder bio,
  hub gateway card and legal typography specimens replicate `pages/*.astro` markup; they convert
  opportunistically when those pages are componentized for their own reasons, never as standalone
  specimen work.

Two things that make replicas drift silently, both of which have happened:

- **Astro `<style>` is scoped**, so a production component's styles never reach a replica of it on
  another page. That is why replicas carry inline styles, and why they diverge unnoticed.
- **Read the media queries, not just the base rule.** `.footer-links` is `gap: var(--spacing-md)` at the
  top of `FooterLinks.astro` and `gap: var(--spacing-2xl)` under `@media (min-width: 768px)` — the
  desktop value is the one a desktop specimen had to match, and missing it is how the old replica
  drifted.

## Design System Architecture

Centralized CSS variable-based design system. Single source of truth in `variables.css`.

### Design Philosophy

- **Tech Brutalist**: Clean, minimal design with bold typography and deliberate spacing
- **Dark Mode Native**: All components work seamlessly in both themes via CSS variables
- **Accessibility First**: Keyboard navigation, focus indicators, screen reader support
- **Performance**: Minimal CSS, no external font dependencies

### Core Tokens (Summary)

Counts are deliberately not stated, matching
[VARIABLES_REFERENCE.md](VARIABLES_REFERENCE.md)'s rule — the parity test is the referee, and a
hand-kept number is not. (The count column this table used to carry was wrong in three separate ways
when it was removed: a Total of 160 against rows summing to 152, over a `:root` that holds 218.)

| Category              | Examples                                                                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Colors (brand + text) | `--color-primary`, `--bg-light`, `--text-primary`                              |
| Primary opacity scale | `--color-primary-02` through `--color-primary-65`                              |
| Component colors      | `--filter-chip-bg`, `--service-card-text`, `--footer-bg`                       |
| Tool-domain colors    | `--hub-authority-blue`, `--dm-*`, `--icg-*`, `--techpar-*`, `--regmap-*`       |
| Misc colors           | `--checkerboard-line`, `--theme-toggle-color`                                  |
| Spacing               | `--spacing-xs` through `--spacing-3xl`, plus `--spacing-1_25`/`-1_75`/`-2_5xl` |
| Gaps                  | `--gap-tight` through `--gap-extra-wide`                                       |
| Typography            | `--font-family`, `--font-weight-*`, `--text-*`                                 |
| Transitions           | `--transition-fast`, `--transition-normal`, `--transition-slow`                |
| Shadows               | `--shadow-sm`, `--shadow-md`, `--shadow-lg`                                    |

> Note: Dark theme variables use `light-dark()` in `:root` — only `color-scheme: dark` and 2 RGB triplets remain in the `html.dark-theme` block. 13 utility classes are defined across `variables.css`, `typography.css`, and `interactions.css`.

**A token name that doesn't exist fails the build.** An undefined custom property does not error
in the browser: the declaration becomes invalid at computed-value time and the property silently
falls back to its inherited value. Thirteen `font-size` declarations shipped that way on the
homepage and services page (`--text-small`/`--text-tiny`, never defined; the real names are
`--text-sm`/`--text-xs`), past `astro check`, both linters and the full suite (BL-147).
`tests/unit/undefined-css-custom-properties.test.ts` now fails on any `var(--name)` in `src` that
nothing in `src` defines, including one hidden behind a fallback. Its header lists what counts as
defined (`--name:` declarations, inline styles, literal `setProperty`, `define:vars` keys) and
what it cannot see.

### Import Order

In stylesheets, always import in cascade order:

```css
@import './variables.css'; /* 1. Design tokens */
@import './typography.css'; /* 2. Typography utilities */
@import './interactions.css'; /* 3. Interaction utilities */
@import './palettes.css'; /* 4. Palette overrides (must follow variables.css) */
```

## Astro-Specific Patterns

### Scoped vs. Global Styles — Decision Tree

| Scenario                                            | Use                                                                           |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Design system tokens, resets, page layout           | Global CSS in `src/styles/`                                                   |
| Single-component visual styles                      | Scoped `<style>` in the `.astro` file                                         |
| **Styling an element a _child_ component renders**  | **Shared module in `src/styles/components/` — see below; or, for a single parent's positional tweak, an anchored `:global()`** |
| Styling dynamically injected HTML (`innerHTML`)     | `:global()` wrapper on the selector                                           |
| Dark theme color switching                          | `light-dark(light, dark)` inline — preferred over `:global(html.dark-theme)`  |
| Dark theme non-color overrides (opacity, etc.)      | `:global(html.dark-theme)` prefix — only for properties that aren't colors    |
| Global keyframes or animations                      | `src/styles/global.css`                                                       |

#### The scoped-rule / foreign-element trap

Astro scopes by **attribute**, not by nesting: a rule written in `Parent.astro` compiles to
`.thing[data-astro-cid-PARENT]`, and an element rendered by `<Child />` carries the **child's**
cid. So a parent styling a child's element produces a rule that matches nothing — no error, no
warning, no unstyled flash. It simply never applies, and the element quietly keeps whatever the
base rule gave it.

This is not the `/brand` replica drift documented above, and `:global()` is not the fix. It is
also **not** caught by an orphan-class scan, because the class does exist and does have rules —
they just carry a cid the element will never have.

The orphan-class scan itself (BL-116) runs on every route in `tests/e2e/accessibility.test.ts`
via `tests/e2e/helpers/orphan-classes.ts`: a class in the rendered DOM with no selector naming it
in any loaded stylesheet fails, unless a per-route `ALLOWED_UNSTYLED` entry names the script or
test that selects it. It also catches the **unloaded-sheet** case — a `.brutal-*` block whose
rules live in a page-split sheet (`map.css`, `progress.css`, …) the page never imports. Its first
run found two of those (the MCP trial panel, the ICG progress bar) and 26 phantom BEM names.
The foreign-element trap above remains guarded only by the unit test below.

**Worked example (BL-139).** `.portfolio-filter-drawer`'s entire mobile treatment — roughly 270
lines across `PortfolioHeader.astro` and `StickyControls.astro` — targeted an element rendered by
`FilterDrawer.astro`. None of it had ever applied: at 375px the drawer computed
`width: 350px; border-left: 2px` — the desktop side panel — on a route that had shipped a "mobile
drawer" for its whole life. Two comments reading _"Drawer styles moved to FilterDrawer.astro"_
recorded a move whose declarations were left behind.

**Remedy order** — put the rule where it *applies*, not where the markup used to be:

1. If the element is rendered by a child, and the styling is positional or shared, move it to a
   `src/styles/components/*.css` module. A plain stylesheet cannot fall into this trap at all.
2. If it genuinely belongs to one component, move it into **that** component's scoped block.
3. Reach for `:global()` only for markup that has no component to own it — the `innerHTML` case
   above — or for a **positional** declaration on a shared utility a child renders, anchored to a
   scoped ancestor. See [When `:global()` Is Necessary](#when-global-is-necessary) case 3.

**It is now a build failure.** `tests/unit/scoped-selector-foreign-element.test.ts` fails on any
scoped selector whose rightmost compound carries a class the same file passes to a component
invocation (`<DeltaIcon class="x" />`, including `class:list` literals), unless that compound is
inside `:global()`. The rule is per usage: a native element carrying the same class elsewhere in
the file does **not** exempt it. For a rule genuinely aimed at the native element in such a file,
put a type selector in the rightmost compound (`svg.bullet-icon`), never an allowlist. Classes
passed to a component that forwards its attributes (`{...Astro.props}`) are not counted, since
that component does receive the caller's cid. Its first run found ten dead blocks (BL-150),
including one on TechPar where the Analysis tab's native `<svg>` got a 64px muted icon and the
Trajectory tab's `<DeltaIcon>`, sharing the same class, shipped 14px at full colour.

**But first ask whether the rule should apply at all.** Dead CSS has usually been dead for a
long time, and nobody has been missing it. BL-139's rules turned out to be the wrong design once
rendered — full-bleed, the drawer covered the page header and the control that opened it — so
they were **deleted, not relocated**. Reviving a rule is a product decision wearing a bug's
clothing: render it before you assume the original author was right.

**Prove it with a rendered measurement, not a reading.** Authored CSS looks identical whether it
applies or not, so the only evidence that a relocation worked is a computed style from a real
browser. That is why the BL-139 tests assert `getComputedStyle` values at each breakpoint.

**Check the browserslist floor before reaching for a newer CSS feature.** `package.json` declares
`Safari >= 14`, and LightningCSS down-levels *some* constructs (`light-dark()`) while emitting
others verbatim with no fallback — viewport units among them. An unsupported unit is therefore
dropped silently at runtime rather than polyfilled at build time, taking its whole declaration
with it.

### `compressHTML` deletes the space before a wrapped inline element

`compressHTML` defaults to **on** and is not set in `astro.config.mjs`. It does not *collapse*
the newline+indent between a line of prose and an inline element opening the next line — it
**deletes** it:

```astro
<!-- Source -->
<p>…request volume) is published at
  <a href="https://status.mcp.globalstrategic.tech/">status.mcp.globalstrategic.tech</a>.</p>

<!-- Ships as -->
published atstatus.mcp.globalstrategic.tech.
```

Same-line spacing is fine, and so is text→text across a break. The **text → inline open
tag** boundary loses its space, which is why the defect appears wherever Prettier happens to
wrap and looks arbitrary rather than systematic. So does an **expression → expression**
boundary: `{count}` on one line and `{unit}` on the next shipped as `3STEPS` in `JobCard.astro`
(2026-09-02); render both from one expression instead, a single template literal that carries
the space itself, which leaves no source whitespace to delete. Fourteen of the text → tag kind were live across six files before
`tests/unit/inline-element-spacing.test.ts` started guarding it.

**Two forms work; both put the space somewhere the compressor cannot reach.**

| Form    | Why it survives                                                          | Use in                                                                |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `&#32;` | a character reference is not source whitespace                            | plain template regions — no expression needed, survives Prettier rewrap |
| `{' '}` | compiles to an expression (`${' '}`), not a text node a compressor can see | JSX-ish regions that already carry expressions                        |

`&#32;` is the default. `{' '}` is equally sound and already load-bearing in the repo — five
sites in `diligence-machine/index.astro` and one in `CTABox.astro`, the latter with a comment
saying so. Do **not** reach for `&nbsp;`: it would wrongly suppress wrapping at that point.
Either form collapses harmlessly against real whitespace if compression is ever turned off.

**It is one mechanism, in both region kinds.** Expression regions (`{cond && (<p>…)}`) are not
exempt, and JSX whitespace handling is not the cause there — established by a 2×2 build probe
(2026-09-02): with the space expression removed, the newline **survives** compilation when
`compressHTML` is off and is **deleted** when it is on, in an expression region, exactly as in
plain template markup. `CTABox.astro`'s comment used to attribute its own instance to JSX; it
now points here.

**Reproduce it through a real `npm run build`, not the standalone compiler.** Astro 7 bundles its
own compiler build, and `@astrojs/compiler` installed on its own *collapses* the whitespace to a
single character where the shipped pipeline *deletes* it — a session checking this the fast way
would conclude this section is wrong.

Turning `compressHTML` off fixes the whole class in one line; it was measured at **+305 KB raw /
+29 KB gzipped** across the site's HTML and rejected on those grounds. Revisit that trade if the
entity count ever gets large.

### `class:list` — Conditional Classes

Use Astro's `class:list` directive for conditionally applying classes. Preferred over template literal concatenation for new code.

```astro
<!-- Preferred -->
<div class:list={['card', { active: isActive, highlighted: score > 90 }]}>
  <!-- Avoid in new code -->
  <div class={`card ${isActive ? 'active' : ''}`}></div>
</div>
```

### `define:vars` — JS-to-CSS Bridging

Use `define:vars` to pass frontmatter variables into scoped `<style>` blocks as CSS custom properties. Preferred over inline `style` attributes for dynamic values.

```astro
---
const accentColor = getThemeColor(category);
---

<style define:vars={{ accentColor }}>
  .card {
    border-left: 3px solid var(--accentColor);
  }
</style>
```

**Limitation**: `define:vars` makes the style tag inline (not bundled). Use sparingly for truly dynamic values, not for values that could be CSS variables.

### When `:global()` Is Necessary

`:global()` breaks Astro's scoping. Only use it when:

1. **Styling dynamically injected content** — Elements created via `innerHTML` in `<script>` blocks don't have Astro's scoping attributes:

   ```css
   :global(.question-card) {
     padding: var(--spacing-md);
   }
   ```

2. **Parent state selectors** — When a component's appearance depends on a class on `<html>` or a parent element:

   ```css
   :global(html.dark-theme) .my-card {
     background: var(--bg-dark-secondary);
   }
   ```

3. **A shared utility on an element a child component renders** — the [scoped-rule /
   foreign-element trap](#the-scoped-rule--foreign-element-trap) above, remedy step 3. A class
   passed to `<DeltaIcon class="…" />` never receives this file's cid, so a bare selector matches
   nothing. Legitimate only when the declaration is **positional** — where the parent puts the
   utility, which is the parent's business — and only ever **anchored to a scoped ancestor**, so
   it stays as narrow as the component:

   ```css
   /* Anchored: .clip-details still carries this file's cid, so this cannot leak. */
   .clip-details > summary :global(.delta-chevron) {
     margin-left: 0;
   }
   ```

   A bare `:global(.delta-chevron) { … }` with no ancestor is a site-wide edit to a shared
   utility; that belongs in `interactions.css`, not a component. If the declaration is anything
   more than positional, remedy steps 1 and 2 still win.

   **Discriminator against remedy step 1**, which also claims positional styling: does the
   declaration serve *this one parent* or a *recurring arrangement*? One parent — where it puts
   the utility is its own business — take the anchored `:global()` here. Recurring across
   components — it is a property of the arrangement, not of any caller — move it to
   `src/styles/components/*.css`. Three components zeroing the same declaration is the signal
   that it has stopped being local.

**Prefer `light-dark()` over `:global(html.dark-theme)`** for color properties. Use `light-dark(light-value, dark-value)` inline or define a CSS variable with `light-dark()` in `variables.css`. Reserve `:global(html.dark-theme)` only for non-color properties (opacity, display, backdrop-filter).

### CSS Linting

The project uses [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) to enforce CSS conventions:

```bash
npm run lint:css    # Lint src/styles/*.css
```

Rules enforce: no duplicate selectors, no duplicate properties, no named colors. See `.stylelintrc.json` for full configuration.

## Component Styling

### Color Selection Quick-Reference

When choosing a color, follow this priority: **Primary teal → Secondary amber → Semantic → Neutrals → Domain**. See [BRAND_GUIDELINES.md — Color Usage Hierarchy](./BRAND_GUIDELINES.md#color-usage-hierarchy) for the full table and rules.

- Interactive elements / brand accents → `--color-primary`
- Status indicators (success/warning/error/info) → `--color-success`, `--color-warning`, `--color-error`, `--color-info`
- Body content, backgrounds, borders → `--text-*`, `--bg-*`, `--border-*`
- Tool-specific only → `--hub-*`, `--dm-*`, `--icg-*`, `--techpar-*`, `--regmap-*`

### Scoped styles (single-use components)

```astro
<div class="custom-card">
  <h2>{title}</h2>
  <slot />
</div>

<style>
  .custom-card {
    padding: var(--spacing-lg);
    background: var(--bg-light-alt);
    border: 2px solid var(--color-primary);
  }

  .custom-card h2 {
    font-size: var(--text-lg);
    color: var(--text-primary);
    margin-bottom: var(--spacing-md);
  }
</style>
```

### Shared styles (reusable components)

Create a stylesheet in `src/styles/`, import it in the component:

```astro
---
import '../../styles/my-component.css';
---
```

### Card grids: the grid owns the columns, the card owns itself

A card must **not** set `max-width` / `margin: 0 auto` on itself. That is page positioning
living on a component, and it silently defeats any layout the card is later dropped into —
`.brutal-gateway-card` carried `max-width: 600px` and so rendered as one centred column in a
1504px container, wasting 60% of every row on both hub gateway indexes (BL-105).

**Exception — centered reading measures.** A prose/CTA box that IS a single centered reading
measure (`.cta-box` in `CTABox.astro`) legitimately carries `max-width` + `margin: 0 auto`:
it is never dropped into a grid, and the cap is its typography, not page positioning. The
ban is on grid *cards* positioning themselves.

The established pairing — `.grid` (`PortfolioGrid.astro`) with `.project-card` (`cards.css`),
and `.brutal-gateway-grid` / `.brutal-gateway-card` (both `cards.css`):

```css
.my-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(<floor>, 1fr));
  gap: var(--spacing-…);
}
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .my-grid {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  }
}
```

`auto-fill` with a floor beats fixed column counts: `.container` is a flat `max-width: 1600px`
with no responsive **max-width** step (its horizontal padding does step — see § Container
queries), so `repeat(3, 1fr)` yields 368px cards at a 1280 viewport and
283px at 1025 — narrower than the same card on a phone. The 768px `1fr` override is also what
stops the `minmax()` floor forcing horizontal scroll on small screens; do not remove it.
And `auto-fill`, not `auto-fit`: `auto-fit` collapses empty tracks, so a sparsely-populated
grid (the `/brand` specimens sit alone in theirs) stretches its lone card across the whole
row and documents a width nothing renders. The specimen documents the grid's *behaviour* —
equal-height rows, bottom-aligned CTA, a surviving empty track — never a width; `/brand`'s
content column is narrower than `.container` by design, so no number there is "the" card width.

**Two traps when the cards become flex children for equal-height rows:**

- Bottom-align the CTA with `flex-grow: 1` on the element above it, **not** `margin-top: auto`
  on the CTA. The tallest card in each row resolves an auto margin to 0 and silently loses the
  gap above its CTA.
- `inline-block` children (CTAs, badges) are blockified by flex and stretch to the full card
  width under the default `align-items: stretch`. Give those items `align-self: center` — not
  `align-items: center` on the card, which shrink-wraps the content list too.

And one trap in the **single-column fallback**, which is where BL-105 nearly shipped a regression:

- Centring a capped card with `margin-inline: auto` needs an explicit `width: 100%` alongside it.
  Auto inline margins on a **grid item** absorb the free space before alignment runs, which
  disables the default `justify-self: stretch` — the card then sizes shrink-to-fit instead of
  filling the track and being clamped by `max-width`. It only shows between the cap and the
  breakpoint (600–768px here), so a check at 480px sees nothing wrong. Assert **uniformity**
  across all cards, not one card's upper bound.

### A flex list item lays out every child, text nodes included

`.brutal-gateway-card__features li` and its page-local equivalents are `display: flex`
so a bullet icon can sit beside the text. That makes **every bare text node inside the
`li` its own anonymous flex item**, laid out and wrapped independently of its
neighbours. A bullet of plain text has exactly one text node and looks fine — which is
why every existing call site looks fine, and why the rule stays hidden until someone
adds a link.

```html
<!-- ✅ two flex items: the icon, and the whole sentence -->
<li>
  <DeltaIcon class="bullet-icon" />
  <span>Paste it into <code>gst_irl_sweep</code>'s <code>filledIrl</code> argument</span>
</li>

<!-- ❌ six flex items; renders as "Paste it into" · gap · "gst_irl_sweep" · gap · … -->
<li><DeltaIcon class="bullet-icon" />Paste it into <code>gst_irl_sweep</code>'s <code>filledIrl</code> argument</li>
```

**The rule**: a bullet carrying any inline element (`<code>`, `<a>`, `<strong>`) must wrap
its prose in one span, so the row is icon + span. Wrapping unconditionally is the safer
habit — it survives the link someone adds later. This shipped broken on the IRL extractor
page before it was caught.

### Variable Usage Priority

1. **Design system variables** for colors, spacing, typography, transitions
2. **Typography utility classes** (`.brutal-heading-lg`, `.brutal-text-base`, `.brutal-label`) for text
3. **Interaction utility classes** (`.interactive`, `.focus-outline`) for hover/focus states

### Available Utility Classes

**From `variables.css`:**

- `.flex-center` — centered flexbox
- `.flex-between` — space-between flexbox
- `.text-uppercase` — uppercase + letter-spacing
- `.text-label` — label styling (xs, bold, uppercase, muted)
- `.interactive-element` — transition + primary color on hover
- `.interactive-focus` — 2px primary outline

**From `interactions.css`:**

- `.interactive` — transition + primary hover + focus-visible outline
- `.link-interactive` — link with underline animation
- `.control-hover` / `.control-active` — button state classes
- `.accent-light-bg` / `.accent-light-bg-hover` — accent backgrounds
- `.focus-outline` / `.focus-outline-sm` — focus ring utilities
- `.delta-chevron` — collapse/expand toggle indicator using the brand delta triangle

**From `global.css`:**

- `.sr-only` — screen reader only (visually hidden)

### Brand Delta Icon

The GST delta icon is available in two forms:

**1. Component (preferred): `DeltaIcon.astro`**

```astro
---
import DeltaIcon from '../components/DeltaIcon.astro';
---

<DeltaIcon size={14} class="bullet-icon" />
```

Renders an inline SVG with `stroke="currentColor"`, so the icon inherits color from its parent CSS. Responds automatically to palette switching and dark theme. Used site-wide for bullet points (`.bullet-icon`), the header logo (`.delta-icon`), theme toggle, chevron indicators, and TOC markers. `<DeltaIcon filled />` paints the same path solid in `currentColor` with no stroke — the current-locale marker in the language menu (BL-153); the default rendering is unchanged.

**2. CSS mask-image (for pseudo-elements only)**

```css
.my-element::before {
  content: '';
  display: inline-block;
  width: 10px;
  height: 10px;
  background-color: var(--color-primary);
  mask-image: url('/images/logo/gst-delta-icon-teal-stroke-thick.svg');
  mask-size: contain;
  mask-repeat: no-repeat;
  -webkit-mask-image: url('/images/logo/gst-delta-icon-teal-stroke-thick.svg');
  -webkit-mask-size: contain;
  -webkit-mask-repeat: no-repeat;
}
```

Use this pattern only for `::before`/`::after` pseudo-elements where an Astro component can't be used. Inherits color via `background-color`.

**Guidelines:**

- Always prefer `DeltaIcon.astro` over `<img>` tags — `<img>` cannot inherit CSS colors
- `.bullet-icon` and `.delta-icon` classes include `color: var(--color-primary)` for palette awareness — brand teal stays teal as ink by decision ([ADR-0035](https://github.com/Global-Strategic-Technologies/gst-website/blob/main/src/docs/adr/0035-ink-tokens-for-text-on-light-surfaces.md))
- The static SVG file (`public/images/logo/gst-delta-icon-teal-stroke-thick.svg`) has hardcoded teal — keep it for favicon, RSS, and external contexts only

## Dark Theme Implementation

### How It Works

The theme system uses CSS `light-dark()` function — a single declaration handles both themes. LightningCSS compiles `light-dark()` to `--lightningcss-light`/`--lightningcss-dark` variable tricks for full browser support. The `html.dark-theme` class sets `color-scheme: dark` which triggers `light-dark()` to resolve to the second (dark) value.

```css
/* variables.css — single declaration, both themes */
:root {
  color-scheme: light;
  --filter-chip-bg: light-dark(rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.05), rgba(5, 205, 153, 0.1));
}

html.dark-theme {
  color-scheme: dark;
}

/* Component just references the variable — switches automatically */
.filter-chip {
  background: var(--filter-chip-bg);
}
```

### Preferred: `light-dark()` (for all color properties)

Use `light-dark(light-value, dark-value)` directly in base rules. Works for `color`, `background`, `border-color`, `fill`, `stroke`, `box-shadow` (color parts), and any property accepting a `<color>` value.

```css
/* In variables.css */
--my-bg: light-dark(#ffffff, #1a1a1a);

/* In scoped component styles */
.my-card {
  border-color: light-dark(var(--border-light), var(--border-dark-default));
}
```

### Fallback: `html.dark-theme` selector (non-color properties only)

`light-dark()` only works for `<color>` values. For non-color properties (`opacity`, `backdrop-filter`, `display`, `font-weight`, `transform`), use the `:global(html.dark-theme)` selector:

```css
/* Cannot use light-dark() for opacity */
:global(html.dark-theme) .overlay {
  opacity: 0.8;
}
```

### Adding Dark Theme Support to New Components

1. Use existing variables wherever possible — most already auto-switch via `light-dark()`:

| Use Case        | Variable                                                    |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Primary text    | `--text-primary` (auto-switches via `light-dark()`)         |
| Secondary text  | `--text-secondary` (auto-switches)                          |
| Muted text      | `--text-muted` (auto-switches)                              |
| Page background | `--bg-light` (auto-switches: `#ffffff` / `#0a0a0a`)        |
| Alt background  | `--bg-light-alt` (auto-switches: `#f5f5f5` / `#141414`)    |
| Primary accent  | `--color-primary` (same in both themes)                     |
| Borders         | `--border-light` (light only) or use `light-dark()` inline  |
| Dark borders    | `--border-dark-default` (dark-specific constant)            |

2. If you need a new theme-switching value, use `light-dark()` in `variables.css`:
   ```css
   :root {
     --my-component-bg: light-dark(#ffffff, #1a1a1a);
   }
   ```
3. For inline theme-switching in scoped styles (no new variable needed):
   ```css
   .my-card {
     background: light-dark(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05), rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05));
   }
   ```
4. Toggle the theme in the browser and verify all elements are visible

## Responsive Design

### Breakpoints

The project uses a **desktop-first** approach with `max-width` breakpoints:

```css
/* Desktop (default) — no media query needed */

@media (max-width: 768px) {
  /* Tablet and below */
}

@media (max-width: 480px) {
  /* Mobile */
}
```

Additional breakpoints used sparingly:

- `@media (min-width: 768px)` — desktop-only styles (used in some components)
- `@media (min-width: 480px) and (max-width: 767px)` — tablet-only range
- `@media print` — print stylesheet
- `540px` / `512px` — the announcement sash only ([sash.css](https://github.com/Global-Strategic-Technologies/gst-website/blob/main/src/styles/components/sash.css) + the reserve in [HeaderNavLinks.astro](https://github.com/Global-Strategic-Technologies/gst-website/blob/main/src/components/HeaderNavLinks.astro)). These are not general breakpoints and nothing else should adopt them: a sash tier switches at the width where its **nav reserve fits**, measured on all three engines against the flat 96px gutter that preceded the ladder in global.css (the nav has since gained 48–64px of container at these widths — 64 below 481, 48 from 481 to 768, so the three numbers are conservative rather than exact — do not move them on that basis, see sash.css), and below 512px no corner reserve fits at all — so the reserve goes to 0 and the production sash **changes form** instead of hiding: it renders as a full-width, in-flow strip above the header (see sash.css), which costs the nav nothing. The two files must switch at the same three numbers or a sash page gains a horizontal scrollbar — and the pairing now has a **conditional fourth rule on the same three numbers**: a sash carrying the optional under-band (`.brutal-sash-under`) grows the desktop corner box to 220px and widens the reserve to match, via a `:has()` rule that is restated inside each tier block (`:has()` matches the band even while it is `display: none`, so a bare base rule would leak the desktop reserve into every tier). Three tables move together: sash.css's geometry header, HeaderNavLinks' reserve rules, and the `BREAKPOINTS` list in [announcement-sash.test.ts](https://github.com/Global-Strategic-Technologies/gst-website/blob/main/tests/e2e/announcement-sash.test.ts).

- [PortfolioHeader.astro](https://github.com/Global-Strategic-Technologies/gst-website/blob/main/src/components/portfolio/PortfolioHeader.astro) stacks its search/filter controls under the page title at the ordinary **1024px** tier, not at a bespoke number. It used to carry a `540px` tier of its own, derived from the width at which the nowrap title plus the controls' minimum (436px of container) fit on one row; that tier was retired 2026-09-04 when the controls block became a growing, shrinkable flex item (so the search box's 375px basis finally applies, instead of collapsing to the input's intrinsic width behind global.css's `width: fit-content` wrapper). A shrinkable block beside a nowrap title squeezes the input as the viewport narrows (303px at 900, 183px at 780, 160px at 640, measured), so the row is kept only where it still gives the input ~400px, which the 1024 tier delivers (427px at 1025; full width below). The 481–540 overflow band the old tier existed to close no longer exists, since the row is gone at those widths. The sticky copy in [StickyControls.astro](https://github.com/Global-Strategic-Technologies/gst-website/blob/main/src/components/portfolio/StickyControls.astro) is `position: fixed` and keeps its own floors.

**Container queries** are sanctioned where a component is rendered at more than one width for the SAME viewport, and only there. [StatsBar.astro](https://github.com/Global-Strategic-Technologies/gst-website/blob/main/src/components/StatsBar.astro) is the first and currently only user: it renders inside the full `.container` on `/ma-portfolio/` and inside the narrower specimen frame on `/brand`, so viewport queries got the specimen wrong at every desktop width. It sets `container-type: inline-size` on its own scoped `.container` and switches at `1094px` / `672px` / `384px`. All three are now container facts, and **none of them can be read as a converted viewport tier**. Only `1094px` was derived from the fitting maths (four columns need a 1095px container to hold a six-character value at 3.5rem); `672px` and `384px` originated as the converted 768/480 tiers and are *retained* — re-derivation when the gutter ladder went live showed that leaving them produces only tier upgrades on both renderings.

That last point used to be false: the lower two were documented as "the 768/480 viewport tiers expressed as container widths, since `.container` costs a constant 96px of padding". `.container` no longer costs a constant anything — its gutter steps 3rem / 1.5rem / 1rem ([global.css](https://github.com/Global-Strategic-Technologies/gst-website/blob/main/src/styles/global.css)), which makes viewport→container **discontinuous**: a wider viewport can yield a narrower container across a breakpoint, so the same container width occurs in two separate viewport bands and no container number can express a viewport tier. The thresholds were re-derived when that ladder went live and all three stayed put, because leaving them produces only tier upgrades on both renderings. **[ADR-0027](https://github.com/Global-Strategic-Technologies/gst-website/blob/main/src/docs/adr/0027-container-query-thresholds-are-container-facts.md) holds the mapping table, the discontinuity and the rejected alternative — read it before moving one of these numbers.**

**Derive these with a margin, not as an equality.** The first cut solved each threshold exactly and shipped whatever slack fell out: four columns cleared a 1064px container by 0.39px, which passed locally (`scrollWidth` rounds the two to a tie) and failed in CI, where Linux rasterizes fractionally wider. A second, worse case hid in the same habit — the 2.5rem tier inherited 2rem side padding down to a 384px container and overflowed by up to 15px across viewports 481–511 (the container widths are the durable half of that account; those viewport numbers pre-date the gutter ladder), a 30px band no sampled test width sat inside. Every tier now clears its longest value by at least 8px, and [stats-bar-fit.test.ts](https://github.com/Global-Strategic-Technologies/gst-website/blob/main/tests/e2e/stats-bar-fit.test.ts) sweeps the whole range against a 4px ink floor rather than sampling widths. A sub-pixel pass is not a pass, and a sampled space cannot show you where its edges are.

Prefer a viewport media query when a component has one rendering. Reach for `@container` when a specimen, a card, a drawer or a split layout gives the same component a second width, because a viewport query cannot see that.

### Text expansion (localized copy)

Since BL-153 the Tier A pages and the chrome render in Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese too ([LOCALIZATION.md](https://github.com/Global-Strategic-Technologies/gst-website/blob/main/src/docs/development/LOCALIZATION.md)). Romance-language copy runs **20–35% longer** than the English it translates, and the header/footer labels are uppercase mono with tracking, which magnifies it. Consequences for CSS:

- Never size a text container to the English string. Anything with `white-space: nowrap`, a fixed `width`, or a width budget derived from a character count (the footer's is documented in [FooterLinks.astro](https://github.com/Global-Strategic-Technologies/gst-website/blob/main/src/components/FooterLinks.astro)) must be re-derived against the **longest** live locale, and the widest page for that check is `/es/services/`.
- Let long words break rather than overflow: `overflow-wrap: anywhere` on prose containers is preferable to `hyphens: auto`, because `hyphens` needs the correct `lang` (which `<html lang>` now supplies) and the mono face has no hyphenation-friendly metrics.
- The nav row is the tightest budget on the site. Header labels are 4–8 characters in every locale by design (`Servicios`, `Serviços`, `Sobre`, `Nosotros`); do not pick a longer translation to fix a nuance — pick a shorter word.
- Verify every localized surface at desktop / 768px / 480px in light and dark, exactly as for a new component; the draft→live checklist in LOCALIZATION.md requires it.

### Touch Targets

**Two floors, and the difference is a ruling, not a preference.** The guarded component families clear **44×44px** (WCAG 2.5.5, AAA) via `--touch-target-min`; everywhere else the bar is **24×24px** (2.5.8, AA) via `--touch-target-min-aa`. Never a raw `44px` or `24px` — see [BRAND_GUIDELINES § Accessibility](./BRAND_GUIDELINES.md#accessibility) for which controls sit where and why the AAA sweep was scoped back. The AA floor is enforced by axe's `target-size` on every route `accessibility.test.ts` scans, so dropping below it fails CI.

```css
.my-control {
  min-height: var(--touch-target-min);
}
```

It is a **floor, not a fixed size**. Components may sit above it where the design calls for it — the ICG wizard nav uses 48px, the diligence-machine document action uses 52px — and those stay as they are. What must never happen is a page-local rule resolving *below* it: `.brutal-choice-btn--unsure` (36px) and a techpar mobile action bar (40px) both did exactly that, silently out-specifying the base rule. [touch-target-floor.test.ts](https://github.com/Global-Strategic-Technologies/gst-website/blob/main/tests/integration/touch-target-floor.test.ts) fails on any `min-height`, `min-width`, `height` or `width` resolving under the token on a guarded selector, including inside Astro `<style>` blocks. It scans declarations that exist, so it catches a bad override — it cannot tell you a component has no floor at all, which is the shape that let `.brutal-btn` sit at 33px in the first place. That gap is covered by the rendered-geometry sweep in [brand-page.test.ts](https://github.com/Global-Strategic-Technologies/gst-website/blob/main/tests/e2e/brand-page.test.ts) § Touch targets.

Use **`min-height`, not `min-width`**, unless the control is a fixed-size icon button: a `min-width` sweep clips `.brutal-segmented` (`max-width: 320px; overflow: hidden`) and stops the radar pills wrapping.

Beware `display` overrides on a button that inherits the floor: swapping `inline-flex` for `inline-block` drops `align-items: center`, leaving the label top-aligned above dead space.

Canonical statement and the documented exception live in [BRAND_GUIDELINES.md § Accessibility](./BRAND_GUIDELINES.md).

### Z-Index Scale

Use the canonical `--z-*` tokens from [variables.css](https://github.com/Global-Strategic-Technologies/gst-website/blob/main/src/styles/variables.css) — **never raw numeric z-index values** (the token block's own comment mandates this). Tool-internal layers (map annotations, chart overlays) may use direct values for contextual reasons; prefer tokens otherwise.

| Token                  | Value   | Usage                                        |
| ---------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `--z-negative`         | `-1`    | `body::before` background grid               |
| `--z-base`             | `1`     | Normal content stacking                      |
| `--z-raised`           | `5`     | Tool content layers (maps, charts)           |
| `--z-sticky`           | `10`    | Sticky headers, dropdowns anchored to content |
| `--z-dropdown`         | `20`    | Floating menus, dropdowns                    |
| `--z-palette-panel`    | `30`    | Palette panel (brand.astro)                  |
| `--z-overlay`          | `50`    | General overlays                             |
| `--z-compliance-panel` | `60`    | Regulatory-map compliance panel              |
| `--z-modal`            | `1000`  | Modal base                                   |
| `--z-modal-overlay`    | `1001`  | Modal backdrop                               |
| `--z-skip-nav`         | `10000` | Skip-nav link (top of page)                  |

## Frosted Glass

Eleven component families carry the treatment **by default** — `.brutal-btn`,
`.brutal-choice-btn`, `.brutal-search`, `.brutal-segmented`, `.brutal-option-card`,
`.brutal-trust-card`, `.brutal-stat-tile`, `.brutal-callout`, `.brutal-faq__item`,
`.brutal-tool-shell`, and `.tool-tab-bar`. (`.tool-action-bar--frosted` is a deliberate
opt-in variant, not a default.) Don't re-apply a `.brutal-frosted*` utility on top of
any of them; it double-blurs.

### Three shapes, not one

"Frosted" is three different treatments here, and picking the wrong one is the failure
this section exists to prevent — it happened during the change that added the four
card/tile families above, and the doc's own wording caused it.

| Shape             | Background                     | Blur  | Edge treatment | Carried by                                                                                                                    |

| **Control triple** | `--surface-subtle-bg` (2%)     | 2px   | ✅ highlight + hairline | The nine control and card families above                                                                              |

| **Opaque panel**   | `--surface-panel-bg` (85%)     | 8px   | ❌ none        | `.tool-tab-bar` alone                                                                                                          |

**The edge treatment is what makes frost visible on a flat page**, not the blur. This
site's ground is a checkerboard grid, and over it the container pair's half-percent tint
is indistinguishable from no treatment at all — the published specimen doc says so
outright ("a frosted pane on a flat background is indistinguishable from an unfrosted
one"), and `BACKLOG.md` records a branch lost to exactly that. Reach for the container
pair only over real content: scrolling body copy, an image, a colored surface.

**One pane owns the glass.** A frosted surface nested inside another frosted surface
blurs an already-blurred backdrop, so the child stays transparent and the container
carries the treatment. Two consequences of that rule, both live in the codebase: on
`.brutal-segmented` the frost sits on the **container** and the segments stay
transparent — with `--active` keeping a **solid** fill, because that fill is the only
signal saying which segment is selected and a translucent wash over the container's own
glass would leave it barely distinguishable from its inactive neighbour; and on the
`/hub/mcp/docs/` Jobs lens the frost was dropped entirely when the cards became
index rows (ADR-0026 § Amendment): a 46px row is not an elevated surface, and the
treatment read as noise at that density. Frost is for shapes with room to hold
it, which is the other half of the same rule.

All `.brutal-btn` buttons include a frosted-glass aesthetic by default:

```css
.brutal-btn {
  backdrop-filter: blur(2px);
  box-shadow:
    inset 0 1px 0 var(--frost-highlight),
    /* wet-glass highlight */ 0 0 0 1px var(--frost-edge); /* hairline edge */
}
```

The `--frost-highlight` / `--frost-edge` pair carries the theme-switched values (see [VARIABLES_REFERENCE.md](./VARIABLES_REFERENCE.md)); use the tokens rather than re-typing the rgba pair on each frosted surface.

> **Do NOT manually write `-webkit-backdrop-filter`** (or any other vendor-prefixed property).
> LightningCSS, wired to the project's [browserslist config](https://github.com/Global-Strategic-Technologies/gst-website/blob/main/package.json) via
> [astro.config.mjs](https://github.com/Global-Strategic-Technologies/gst-website/blob/main/astro.config.mjs), automatically adds vendor prefixes based on
> the browser target set at build time. Manually writing both forms caused a production
> regression in Phase 3 where LightningCSS deduplicated the pair and shipped only the
> webkit version, breaking frosted glass for Firefox users. See
> [DEVELOPER_TOOLING.md § Browser support](https://github.com/Global-Strategic-Technologies/gst-website/blob/main/src/docs/development/DEVELOPER_TOOLING.md) for details.

- **Primary buttons** use semi-transparent `rgba(5, 205, 153, 0.15)` background instead of solid teal
- **Secondary buttons** use `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.02)` tint instead of fully transparent
- Dark theme adjusts opacity and uses `--border-dark-subtle` for the inset highlight

Additional frosted-glass utilities in `global.css`:

| Class                        | Blur              | Shape                                  | Use Case                          |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `.brutal-frosted`            | 3px               | Container pair                         | Containers over content           |
| `.brutal-frosted--heavy`     | 6px               | Container pair, heavier tint (75%/60%) | Drawers, sticky bars over content |
| `.brutal-frosted--blur-only` | 1.5px             | **Its own** — edge treatment, but `transparent` in light theme, plus a dark-theme contrast/brightness lift | Subtle wet-glass sheen, over content only |
| `.brutal-frosted--overlay`   | 6px + 92% opacity | Opaque panel                           | Modal/panel overlays              |

`--blur-only` is the one to be careful with: it carries the highlight and hairline edge,
which reads as the control triple, over a background that is fully transparent in light
theme. That combination is precisely what `BACKLOG.md` records costing a branch, and it
is why it does not reduce to any of the three shapes above.

## Hub Tool Patterns

Recurring patterns used across hub tools (ICG, TechPar, Tech Debt Calculator, Diligence Machine).

### `HubHeader` owns the space above and below the page title

A page that renders `HubHeader` **must not add its own top padding** to the section
wrapping it. The component already contributes `--spacing-3xl` above the title and
`--spacing-2xl` below the subtitle, and both scale at the 768/480 breakpoints. A
second helping on the section stacks: it does not replace the component's.

```css
/* ✅ the page owns its BOTTOM padding only */
.my-hub-tool {
  padding: 0 0 5rem;
}

/* ❌ stacks 3xl on the 3xl HubHeader already contributes, starting this page's
   title 48px lower than every other Hub page */
.my-hub-tool {
  padding: var(--spacing-3xl) 0 5rem;
}
```

Five pages had drifted this way (both IRL tools, the Diligence Machine, and all
three Library guides), which is why the rule is written down rather than left to
be noticed. The measurable invariant: on every page carrying an unmodified
`HubHeader`, the `h1` starts at the same offset and the gap from the subtitle to
the first content block is `--spacing-2xl`.

The `/hub/mcp/*` guide pages are a deliberate exception — they zero the component
and supply their own `.guide-hero` chrome (see `mcp-guide.css`).

### Print Stylesheets

Hub tools whose output is meant to be taken into a meeting — ICG, TechPar, the Tech
Debt Calculator, the Diligence Machine, the Regulatory Map — include a `@media print`
block in their scoped styles with a consistent structure. The two IRL tools do not:
their deliverable is a file you download or a body you paste, so there is nothing on
screen worth printing. Add the block when a tool's on-screen result **is** the artifact.

```css
@media print {
  /* Hide interactive elements */
  .site-header,
  footer,
  .actions,
  [data-view='landing'],
  [data-view='wizard'] {
    display: none !important;
  }

  /* Show results */
  [data-view='results'] {
    display: block !important;
  }

  /* Prevent card breaks */
  .card {
    break-inside: avoid;
    border: 1px solid #ddd;
  }

  /* Auto-expand collapsibles */
  .collapsed .desc {
    max-height: none !important;
    opacity: 1 !important;
  }

  /* Shell goes full-width */
  .brutal-tool-shell {
    max-width: 100%;
  }
}
```

**Convention**: Hardcoded colors (e.g., `#ddd`, `#333`) are acceptable in print styles since print always renders on white paper. CSS variables that resolve to dark theme values would produce invisible content in print.

### `:global()` for Dynamically Injected Content

Hub tools render content via `innerHTML` at runtime (questions, recommendations, chart elements). Astro scopes `<style>` selectors to statically-rendered elements, so dynamically injected HTML requires `:global()`:

```css
/* Static element — scoped selector works */
.wizard-content {
  padding: var(--spacing-xl) var(--spacing-lg);
}

/* Dynamic element — must use :global() */
:global(.question-card) {
  padding: var(--spacing-md) var(--spacing-lg);
  border: 1px solid var(--border-light);
}

/* Dark theme override for dynamic element */
:global(html.dark-theme .question-card) {
  border-color: rgba(5, 205, 153, 0.12);
}
```

**When to use**: Any CSS targeting elements created via `innerHTML`, `insertAdjacentHTML`, or similar DOM APIs in a `<script>` block.

### Tool Shell Container

Hub tools use the standardized `.brutal-tool-shell` class defined in `global.css`. This provides a centered, themed container with consistent border-radius, background, and responsive padding.

```css
/* Base: 700px centered container */
.brutal-tool-shell { max-width: 700px; margin: 0 auto; ... }

/* Width modifiers */
.brutal-tool-shell--narrow   { max-width: 660px; }  /* ICG */
.brutal-tool-shell--wide     { max-width: 760px; }  /* Tech Debt Calculator */
.brutal-tool-shell--document { max-width: 800px; }  /* Diligence Machine */
.brutal-tool-shell--fluid    { max-width: 100%; }   /* TechPar */
```

**Content wrapper**: Use `.brutal-tool-shell__content` inside the shell for automatic responsive padding:

```css
.brutal-tool-shell__content {
  padding: var(--spacing-xl) var(--spacing-lg); /* Desktop */
}
/* Automatically reduces to var(--spacing-lg) var(--spacing-md) at 480px */
```

**HTML template**:

```html
<section class="tool-section">
  <div class="container">
    <HubHeader title="..." subtitle="..." />
    <div class="brutal-tool-shell brutal-tool-shell--narrow">
      <div class="brutal-tool-shell__content">
        <!-- Tool-specific content -->
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
```

**Print**: Shell expands to full width with no border or radius.

### Skeleton Loading Placeholders

For components that load content asynchronously, use the skeleton loading pattern. The `@keyframes pulse` animation and the classes below are defined in [`src/styles/components/skeleton.css`](https://github.com/Global-Strategic-Technologies/gst-website/blob/main/src/styles/components/skeleton.css).

**Canonical reference**: the live specimens on [`/brand`](https://github.com/Global-Strategic-Technologies/gst-website/blob/main/src/pages/brand.astro) — see `src/components/brand/BrandComponents.astro`, which is the in-repo control example for this pattern.

> Do **not** reach for a skeleton to defer a page's primary content **on a page you want indexed**. Crawlers run JS on a deferred queue and judge the shell, so the page gets rated on whatever the skeleton is standing in for. `/hub/radar` is the exception that proves the rule rather than a violation of it: its feed _is_ deferred behind a skeleton, and that is fine precisely because the page is `noindex` — a rotating feed with no per-item permalinks is not an indexable page type. See [ADR-0012](https://github.com/Global-Strategic-Technologies/gst-website/blob/main/src/docs/adr/0012-rotating-feeds-are-noindex.md) and [RADAR.md § Why the feed is a server island](https://github.com/Global-Strategic-Technologies/gst-website/blob/main/src/docs/hub/RADAR.md). If you are deferring primary content on an indexable page, you have the wrong tool.

**Global classes** — two families, and they are not interchangeable.

Brutalist (current design system; what new work should use):

| Class                      | Description                                   |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `.brutal-skeleton-bar`     | Rectangular placeholder bar (0.875rem height) |
| `.brutal-skeleton-bar--sm` | Smaller bar variant (0.625rem height)         |
| `.brutal-skeleton-dot`     | Square placeholder (8px, `border-radius: 0`)  |

These are outlined, not filled: `background: transparent` with a `1px solid var(--color-primary)` border, animated with the stepped `brutal-blink`. `RadarFeedSkeleton.astro` is the in-repo consumer.

Legacy (soft/filled, retained for existing callers):

| Class               | Description                                   |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `.skeleton-bar`     | Rectangular placeholder bar (0.875rem height) |
| `.skeleton-bar--sm` | Smaller bar variant (0.625rem height)         |
| `.skeleton-dot`     | Circular placeholder (8px)                    |

These use `var(--accent-light-bg-hover)` for background color (auto-switches in dark theme) and the smooth `pulse` animation.

```html
<!-- Example: text block skeleton -->
<div class="skeleton-bar" style="width: 80%"></div>
<div class="skeleton-bar skeleton-bar--sm" style="width: 40%; animation-delay: 0.3s"></div>
```

**Convention**:

- Vary bar widths via inline `style` to suggest natural content variation
- Add `aria-hidden="true"` to the skeleton container
- Stagger animation delays on consecutive elements (e.g., `animation-delay: 0.3s`)

**Content swap pattern**:

1. Render the skeleton as the default visible state
2. Set `aria-hidden="true"` on the skeleton wrapper so screen readers skip it
3. When real content loads (via client-side JS), hide the skeleton and show the content
4. Example: `skeletonEl.style.display = 'none'; contentEl.style.display = 'block';`

**Micro-spacing exception**: Skeleton element heights (`0.875rem`, `0.625rem`, `0.375rem`) approximate text line heights and are not layout spacing — these are acceptable as hardcoded rem values since the spacing scale is not designed for visual approximation of text dimensions.

### Delta Chevron — Collapse/Expand Indicator

The `.delta-chevron` utility (defined in `interactions.css`) provides a collapse/expand toggle indicator using the brand delta triangle SVG. It points down when expanded and up when collapsed, rotating via CSS transition.

**HTML:**

```html
<svg class="delta-chevron" viewBox="0 0 64 64" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <path
    d="M32 12 L52 52 L12 52 Z"
    fill="none"
    stroke="currentColor"
    stroke-width="6"
    stroke-linejoin="miter"
  />
</svg>
```

**Behavior:**

- Expanded: triangle points down (`rotate(180deg)`), teal (`--color-primary`)
- Collapsed: triangle points up (`rotate(0deg)`), muted (`--text-muted`)
- Both transitions run on `var(--transition-fast)`
- No dark-theme override needed — `--text-muted` is a `light-dark()` token, so the collapsed colour switches with the theme on its own

**Collapsed is collapsed, whichever mechanism drives it.** Two are supported and they must
look identical:

| Mechanism    | Collapsed selector                            | Use when                    |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| JS-toggled   | a parent carries `.is-collapsed`               | the open state is scripted  |
| `<details>`  | `details:not([open]) > summary .delta-chevron` | native disclosure, no JS    |

Changing one branch's resting appearance means changing the other. The `<details>` branch
shipped with the rotation but not the muted colour, so every native disclosure on the site
sat teal while closed until it was corrected — and no `/brand` specimen caught it, because
all of them demonstrate the JS-toggled pattern.

**Convention:**

- Place the SVG as the last child inside the collapsible header/title row
- Toggle `.is-collapsed` on the card/container element, not the chevron itself
- In print styles, hide with `:global(.delta-chevron) { display: none !important; }`
- **Leading with the chevron instead? Zero its `margin-left`.** The utility carries
  `margin-left: auto` for the last-child home above. First in a flex row, that margin absorbs
  the row's free space and shoves the whole row flush right — measured at 352px and 433px on
  ClipFigure's two `/hub/mcp/get-started` blocks, landing the label at a different x in each,
  since the free space is whatever the container's `max-width` leaves. It is silent wherever a
  sibling has `flex: 1` (FyiItem's title), because flexing consumes the free space first — so
  the bug appears only in some leading-chevron rows, which is what makes it easy to miss.
  `JobCard.astro`, `ClipFigure.astro` and the IRL generator all zero it the same way:

  ```css
  /* :global() is required — the class rides a <DeltaIcon> call, so the scope
     attribute never lands on the rendered <svg>. See the scoped-rule trap above. */
  .clip-details > summary :global(.delta-chevron) {
    margin-left: 0;
  }
  ```

**Current usage**: both branches are used widely — JS-toggled by ICG recommendations and Diligence Machine attention cards/questions, `<details>` by the Hub landing and MCP pages, services, regulatory map, ClipFigure and FyiItem. It is a shared utility, so treat any change to it as site-wide and enumerate consumers with `grep -rl delta-chevron src/` rather than trusting a list here.

## Anti-Patterns

### 1. Hardcoded Colors

```css
/* BAD */
.text {
  color: #1a1a1a;
}
/* GOOD */
.text {
  color: var(--text-primary);
}
```

Colors must use CSS variables so dark theme works automatically.

> **This is mechanically enforced.** Since July 28, 2026 a hardcoded color is a stylelint **error** — it fails `npm run lint:css`, the pre-commit hook, and CI. The rule covers `/color$/`, `fill`, `stroke`, `box-shadow`, `text-shadow`, and the color slot of `border`/`background`/`outline` shorthands. Any value that references a token passes, including `light-dark(var(--a), var(--b))`, `color-mix(in srgb, var(--x) 12%, transparent)` and `rgba(var(--rgb), .5)`. Mechanics: [DEVELOPER_TOOLING.md § stylelint configuration notes](https://github.com/Global-Strategic-Technologies/gst-website/blob/main/src/docs/development/DEVELOPER_TOOLING.md).
>
> **Need a tint that has no token?** Reach for `color-mix(in srgb, var(--color-success) 12%, transparent)` before minting one — it stays correct across themes and all six palettes, which a frozen `rgba(46, 139, 87, 0.12)` does not. For neutral washes use the `--surface-*-bg` family; for modal/drawer backdrops use `--scrim-15…60`; for frosted edges use `--frost-highlight`/`--frost-edge`.
>
> **Two documented exceptions**, both legal because custom-property declarations are never checked by the rule:
>
> 1. **`@media print` blocks** keep literal `#000`/`#fff`/`#ccc` — paper has no theme. Wrap the block in `/* stylelint-disable scale-unlimited/declaration-strict-value -- print output is deliberately literal */ … /* stylelint-enable … */` with that justification.
> 2. **Channel-specific affordances** — the R/G/B slider controls in `SwatchControlStyles.astro` must stay red/green/blue regardless of palette. Declare such colors once as component-local custom properties; never repeat the literal inline.

### 1b. Off-Scale Font Sizes

```css
/* BAD */
.label {
  font-size: 13px;
}
/* GOOD */
.label {
  font-size: var(--text-sm);
}
```

Font sizes come from the `--text-*` scale. This is enforced at **warning** severity (not error) while 150 pre-existing off-scale literals are worked through — see [STYLES_REMEDIATION_ROADMAP.md § 14](./STYLES_REMEDIATION_ROADMAP.md) and BL-094. **New code should produce no new warnings.** Do not bulk-snap existing off-scale values to the nearest token: that changes rendered type, and the repo has no visual-regression coverage to catch a layout break.

### 2. Duplicate Dark Theme Selectors

```css
/* BAD — 50+ manual overrides */
html.dark-theme .button {
  color: #05cd99;
}
html.dark-theme .link {
  color: #f5f5f5;
}

/* GOOD — override the variable, components inherit */
html.dark-theme {
  --button-color: #05cd99;
  --text-color: #f5f5f5;
}
```

### 3. Hardcoded Spacing

```css
/* BAD */
.card {
  padding: 14px;
  margin: 23px;
}
/* GOOD */
.card {
  padding: var(--spacing-lg);
  margin: var(--spacing-md);
}
```

**Micro-spacing exception**: `1px`, `2px` or `3px`, written in px, are acceptable for badge padding, border-radius fine-tuning, and optical alignment, since the spacing scale starts at 4px. The exception ends there: `4px` and every other on-scale px value must be the token, and both `lint:css` and `spacing-token-floor.test.ts` fail on it ([ADR-0029 § The px half](https://github.com/Global-Strategic-Technologies/gst-website/blob/main/src/docs/adr/0029-spacing-scale-enforcement.md#the-px-half-bl-151-amended-2026-09-15)). Example: `padding: 2px var(--spacing-sm)` is acceptable for compact badges; `padding: 2px 8px` is not.

**This is enforced, as of ADR-0029 — a rem or px spacing literal that has an exact token fails
`lint:css`** (px since BL-151). Two instruments hold it, and they have different reach:

| | catches | misses |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `declaration-property-value-disallowed-list` (stylelint, **error**) | `<style>` blocks **and inline `style=` attributes**; fails at editor, pre-commit and CI | exempts a whole declaration containing `calc()` |
| `tests/integration/spacing-token-floor.test.ts` (vitest) | `<style>` blocks; judges `calc()` **per shorthand part**, so `1.25rem calc(…)` is still caught | inline `style=` attributes |

The guard is the referee — it derives the scale from `variables.css` rather than hardcoding it, and
it owns the accepted-residual table.

**Adding an off-scale value?** It is not a lint failure (the rule names on-scale values only), but
the guard will flag it as an unaccepted residual. The remedy is a ruling in ADR-0029's table with a
reason, not a `stylelint-disable`. Reserve the disable comment for the shape the `@media print`
exception uses — a whole block that is deliberately literal — and always with a justification:

```css
/* stylelint-disable declaration-property-value-disallowed-list -- <why this block is literal> */
```

**Sixteen values are already admitted** — above the ramp (`4rem`, `5rem`), below its 4px floor
(`0.0625rem`, `0.125rem`, `0.15rem`), and between steps. Two are derived constants rather than
chosen steps — the search input's icon clearance, `left: 0.875rem` and the `2.25rem` padding that
clears it. (Values inside `calc()` are derived too, but they are exempt by ruling and are therefore
not among the sixteen.) Read the table before adding a seventeenth — several are partners in one
declaration, and
snapping half of a tuned pair is worse than either leaving both or moving both.

### 4. Hardcoded Font Sizes

```css
/* BAD */
.title {
  font-size: 32px;
}
/* GOOD */
<h1 class="brutal-heading-lg">Title</h1>
/* or */   .title {
  font-size: var(--text-xl);
}
```

### 5. Inline Styles and `!important`

Defeats the cascade. Use component or utility classes instead.

### 6. Hardcoded Transitions

```css
/* BAD */
.card {
  transition: all 0.3s;
}
/* GOOD */
.card {
  transition: all var(--transition-normal);
}
```

### 7. Creating Unnecessary Variables

Check existing variables first. Don't create `--my-special-bg: #f5f5f5` when `--bg-light-alt` already exists.

### 8. Unused CSS

Delete dead styles. Version control has the history.

### 9. Hardcoded Primary Opacity

```css
/* BAD */
.tag {
  background: rgba(5, 205, 153, 0.1);
}
/* GOOD */
.tag {
  background: var(--color-primary-10);
}
/* BEST */
.tag {
  background: var(--accent-dark-bg);
} /* when a semantic alias exists */
```

Use `--color-primary-XX` opacity tokens (see [VARIABLES_REFERENCE — Opacity Scale](./VARIABLES_REFERENCE.md#primary-color-opacity-scale)). Prefer the semantic alias (`--accent-*-bg`, `--accent-border-*`) when one matches your intent.

### 10. Hardcoded Dark-Theme Borders

```css
/* BAD */
html.dark-theme .card {
  border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15);
}
/* GOOD */
html.dark-theme .card {
  border: 1px solid var(--border-dark-default);
}
```

Three tiers: `--border-dark-subtle` (0.10), `--border-dark-default` (0.15), `--border-dark-prominent` (0.20).
